Here are some of the projects I've worked on

### Class Projects

#### Scheme Interpreter - Spring 2012 


#### Puzzle Solver - Fall 2012 


#### Spatial Database - Fall 2012
Built a Java simulation of a car that would turn at 45Ëš angle if it detected a radar pulse from a post. Created the data structure of quadtree from scratch that was used to track and store the coordinates of the car and posts.

#### Puzzle Solver - Fall 2012 

#### Lines of Actions - Fall 2012
Coded and designed a user interface the board game Lines of Action in Java to display and play the game. Implemented a graph data structure using nested arrays to track the pieces and see if there was a win. Wrote an AI that would search for a win in two moves, otherwise it would make a random move.

#### MapReduce - Spring 2013 
Using the MapReduce function in the Hadoop API, built a graph and calculated the total distances from each node and then outputted a histogram of different distances. Used data parallelism with the same program on Amazon EC2 Servers.

#### Matrix Multiply - Spring 2013 
Optimized matrix multiplication in C using different techniques such as SSE instructions, cache blocking, register blocking, loop unrolling, and OpenMP parallelization.

#### Cal Apps - Fall 2013
