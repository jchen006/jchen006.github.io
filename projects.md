Here are some of the projects I've worked on

### Class Projects

#### Scheme Interpreter - Spring 2012 
Wrote a Scheme Interpreter in Python that ran multiple functions of Scheme.

#### Puzzle Solver - Fall 2012 
Built in Java a puzzle solver that utilized regular expressions to analyze formatted clues and answer formatted questions based on clues, Designed an algorithm that would generate all the different possibilities based on the three categories of person, occupation, and house color and eliminate possibilities based on the association from the clues.

#### Spatial Database - Fall 2012
Built a Java simulation of a car that would turn at 45Ëš angle if it detected a radar pulse from a post. Created the data structure of quadtree from scratch that was used to track and store the coordinates of the car and posts.

#### Lines of Actions - Fall 2012
Coded and designed a user interface the board game Lines of Action in Java to display and play the game. Implemented a graph data structure using nested arrays to track the pieces and see if there was a win. Wrote an AI that would search for a win in two moves, otherwise it would make a random move.

#### MapReduce - Spring 2013 
Using the MapReduce function in the Hadoop API, built a graph and calculated the total distances from each node and then outputted a histogram of different distances. Used data parallelism with the same program on Amazon EC2 Servers.

#### Matrix Multiply - Spring 2013 
Optimized matrix multiplication in C using different techniques such as SSE instructions, cache blocking, register blocking, loop unrolling, and OpenMP parallelization.

#### Cal Apps - Fall 2013 
Built a SaaS application for UC Berkeley students to exhibit their applications using Ruby on Rails.

#### Relational Databae - Fall 2013 
Created a Simple Database that could process concurrent SQL queries to modify, join, and aggregate tables. Developed a Selinger cost-based query optimizer to efficiently process operations within the query. Implemented strict two-phase locking to ensure isolation and atomicity of concurrent transactions. Rigorously tested functionality and edge cases with the JUnit testing framework.
